# Fashion MNIST Classification with PyTorch
## Overview
This project is part of the Deep Learning with PyTorch course, which is a graded assignment in the IBM AI Engineering program on Coursera. The goal of this project is to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images in the Fashion MNIST dataset using PyTorch.
## Project Objectives
- Load and preprocess the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- Apply imagetransformations using transforms.Compose().
- Build and train a CNN model with and without Batch Normalization.
- Use SGD optimizer with Cross Entropy Loss for training.
- Evaluate model accuracy (expected >85%) and plot cost trends.
- Document training results with validation screenshots.
## Technologies Used
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Matplotlib
- Pandas & NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
## Results
- Model training achieved >85% validation accuracy.
- Loss decreased over epochs, showing stable training.
- Cost and accuracy plots were generated to visualize performance.
## Acknowledgment
